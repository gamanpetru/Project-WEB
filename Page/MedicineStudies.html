            “MedicineStudies” is the name of website that reflects the scope. The name is combined by two words:
            “medicine” and “studies”. The word “medicine” is mean “the science and art of diagnosing and treating

            Language, 5th Edition. The word “studies” is linked to combine the science and every student around the
            world which wants to learn more about diseases.

            <h2><span>5. </span>Design and implementation constraints</h2>
            <p>
                First of all, for the good development of the project and the compatibility of
                the tools used the OS used is Windows OS (7 or higher). Our server must support both HTTP and HTTPS
                connections with the clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, JDK 1.8.0_201 is required to be used in order to develop the back-end functionalities,
                compilation, debugging etc. As an
                Integrated Development Environment, Eclipse-JEE-2018-12 that comes with Maven 3 embedded is a suitable
                choice for the project requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The framework used in the Back-End development process is Spring, to be more specific the modules Spring
                Boot, Spring MVC and Spring Data for
                Java are required to be added as project dependencies with the help of Maven. In order to map Java
                objects into database tables Hibernate ORM
                framework was chosen in order to help us with this task. Another necessary framework, this time for
                Front End, is Bootstrap 4 for CSS styling and
                layout and jQuery 3.3.1 library to help in manipulating DOM objects easier and better JavaScript code
                writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, for the Front-End side of the app HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript is necessary. In order to dynamically
                render pages from the server, Thymeleaf
                template engine will be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to generate the desired reports and persist data from the website such as registered users,
                orders, reviews, Oracle 12c database version
                12.2.0.1 has been chosen for this task. Moreover, to make the connection to the database possible, JDBC8
                java driver was installed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The web server chosen is Apache Tomcat version 9.0.16, which comes bundled with Spring.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the proper versioning of the app we decided to opt for Git as a Distributed Version Control System.
                Furthermore, we chosen GitHub as hosting service for the project storage.
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Search and browse through the list of books that match a given query.</li>
                    <li>View information about a book, including metadata, availability and price, links to the preview
                        page.</li>
                    <li>Manage your own bookshelves.</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    To require an API key:
                    <li>Open the Credentials page in the API Console.</li>
                    <li>This API supports two types of credentials. Create whichever credentials are appropriate for
                        your project: </li>

                            sends a client ID and,
                            possibly, a client secret to obtain a token. You can generate OAuth 2.0 credentials for web
                            applications, service accounts, or installed applications.</li>
