            <h1>MedicineStudies Privacy Policy</h1>
            <br>
            <p>MedicineStudies understands how important the privacy of personal information is to our users. This
                Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you and about your use of MedicineStudies
                and its services. It will explain the choices you have about how your personal information is used and
                how we protect that information. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
            <br>

            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites owned and operated by MedicineStudies that are intended for use
                by consumers (non-professionals) for non-commercial personal, family or household purposes, including
                MedicineStudies.com, MedicineNet.com, RxList.com, OnHealth.com, and eMedicineHealth.com and including
                the mobile optimized versions of these sites and our Mobile Device Applications or "Apps" (we refer to
                these sites and Apps collectively as the “MedicineStudies Sites”). We refer to the MedicineStudies Sites
                and Apps, along with the information and services made available to you through the MedicineStudies
                Sites and Apps, as the “Services.”</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy also applies to the consumer-facing version of the MedicineStudies Health Manager
                Product. However, if you are an employee or health plan member who has enabled access to your health
                record at MedicineStudies.com by registering at your employer's or health plan's website, the privacy
                policy applicable to your information at your employer's or health plan's website remains applicable to
                your personal health record at MedicineStudies.com. If your employer or health plan account is no longer
                made available to you by your employer or health plan, you will continue to have access to your health
                information from MedicineStudies.com, using the same username and password, but will be subject to this
                Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the MedicineStudies Sites also
                apply to the Apps. If you do not want us to collect, use or disclose information about you and your use
                of the Services as described in this Privacy Policy, then you should not use the Services. By using the
                Services, you must agree to the MedicineStudies Terms of Use, which is the contract between us and users
                of the Services. By accepting the MedicineStudies Terms of Use, you confirm that you have read and
                understand this Privacy Policy and the MedicineStudies Cookie Policy and you acknowledge that we will
                store, use and otherwise process your information in the United States where we are located.</p>
            <p>References to "MedicineStudies," “we” or “us” mean MedicineStudies LLC, including any company that
                MedicineStudies LLC controls (for example, a subsidiary that MedicineStudies LLC owns). MedicineStudies
                may share information among its subsidiaries or websites that it owns or controls, but information
                collected under this Privacy Policy is always protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy. Except
                as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, MedicineStudies LLC is the data controller responsible for
                the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Information Collected About You</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Some of our Services (such as certain quizzes or calculators) do not retain your personal information,
                while others (such as MedicineStudies Lab Testing and the Ovulation/Pregnancy Calendar and the Healthy
                Target Program in the MedicineStudies App and certain of our registration-only Apps like MedicineStudies
                Baby, MedicineStudies Pregnancy and MedicineStudies Allergy) store your personal information in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy. Even if you do not register with or provide any personal
                information to MedicineStudies, we collect information about your use of the MedicineStudies Sites and
                Apps and the Services. We may also acquire information about our users from external sources.
                When you use the Services, we collect information as follows: </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Registration</h3>
            <br>

            <p>While you may use most of the Services without registering, certain Services do require that you register
                with MedicineStudies for them to function properly. If you choose to register or update an existing
                account with MedicineStudies or access certain Services, you may be required to provide certain personal
                information, such as your name, address, telephone number, gender, email address and date of birth, and
                a username and password to access your MedicineStudies account. You are responsible for ensuring the
                accuracy of the personal information that you submit to MedicineStudies. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Interactive Services</h3>
            <br>

            <p>Some of our Services, such as MedicineStudies Symptom Checker, are interactive and may request that you
                submit health-related information, along with other information such as your age and gender. You are not
                required to register with MedicineStudies to use MedicineStudies Symptom Checker and if you are
                registered with MedicineStudies, we do not associate information that you submit to the Symptom Checker
                with registration information that you have previously provided. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>MedicineStudies Health Manager</h3>
            <br>

            <p>MedicineStudies Health Manager provides you with a secure place to gather, store, manage and share your
                personal information and provides tools and services to better manage your health and the health of your
                family. You are required to register with MedicineStudies to use MedicineStudies Health Manager.
                MedicineStudies Health Manager has the ability to use information that you provide to send you
                personalized emails or secure electronic messages. However, MedicineStudies does not allow any third
                parties to gather any data about you in connection with your use of the MedicineStudies Health Manager
                including through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies. Furthermore, MedicineStudies does
                not use any information that you submit in connection with MedicineStudies Health Manager to deliver any
                advertisements to you on or off of the MedicineStudies Sites. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>MedicineStudies Lab Testing</h3>
            <br>

            <p>Certain MedicineStudies users located in the United States may be eligible to participate in
                MedicineStudies Lab Testing, a service powered by PWNHealth, which enables you to place a secure online
                order for certain lab tests. Once you’ve ordered your test, you’ll visit a designated testing center
                where an experienced lab technician will collect your samples. MedicineStudies has selected PWNHealth to
                provide care coordination (including independent physician review of test orders) and other
                administrative services (including processing credit card payments for the lab test orders). Ordering a
                lab test with MedicineStudies Lab Testing requires you to register with MedicineStudies. MedicineStudies
                will share the personal information you use to register with MedicineStudies with PWNHealth for purposes
                of processing and administering your lab test order. You will be able to access your lab test orders and
                results from PWNHealth through your MedicineStudies account but MedicineStudies will never receive your
                lab test results or your payment information. Only PWNHealth will have access to this information.
                PWNHealth may disclose to MedicineStudies certain personal information in the aggregate which does not
                identify you. PWNHealth will use your personal information and other information it collects about you
                in providing the MedicineStudies Lab Testing services in accordance with its privacy policy available
                here and terms of use available here. When you interact with MedicineStudies Lab Testing you may
                interact with certain website pages that are hosted by MedicineStudies or by PWNHealth. This Privacy
                Policy describes what information MedicineStudies collects about you when you use MedicineStudies’s
                Services and how that information is used, disclosed, and maintained by MedicineStudies. PWNHealth’s
                privacy policy and terms of use will appear on any website page that is hosted by PWNHealth. For the
                avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy only applies to the MedicineStudies Site pages hosted by
                MedicineStudies. MedicineStudies and PWNHealth will use cookies and other tracking technologies to
                collect information about your usage of MedicineStudies Lab Testing, including which lab tests you have
                viewed and to statistically analyze trends and other user behavior on the MedicineStudies Lab Testing
                pages. Other than PWNHealth, MedicineStudies does not allow any third parties to gather any data about
                you in connection with your purchase of a lab test through MedicineStudies Lab Testing including through
                the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. Furthermore, MedicineStudies does not use any
                personal information that you submit in connection with MedicineStudies Lab Testing to deliver any
                advertisements to you on or off of the MedicineStudies Sites. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Email Newsletters</h3>
            <br>

            <p>At registration and at various times as you use the MedicineStudies Sites, you will be given the option
                of providing us with personal information in order to receive informational/promotional newsletters –
                such as a newsletter relating to a specific health condition – via email from MedicineStudies and/or
                directly from third parties. From time to time MedicineStudies may offer users of third party websites
                to the opportunity to subscribe to our newsletters through those websites. If you elect to subscribe to
                one of our newsletters on a third party website, the operator of that website will provide us with the
                personal information you have provided in connection with the subscription request, which we may use in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy as though you had provided it directly to MedicineStudies. In
                MedicineStudies Message Boards, if you turn on the email notification for posts you have created or
                participated in, you'll receive an email when there has been any activity on those posts. If you later
                decide you no longer want to receive email updates, you can turn it off by navigating to the Email
                Alerts section in your Message Board settings. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Email a Friend</h3>
            <br>

            <p>If you use our Email a Friend service to tell a friend about a feature on a MedicineStudies Site or a
                newsletter, we will ask you for your name, your email address and your friend's email address. We will
                automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site using your name
                and email address as the "from" email address. MedicineStudies does not use your friend's email
                information for any other purpose. We will only use the information you provide to send the requested
                email to your friend.
                If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would
                like to request that it be removed from our database, please use the Contact Us link provided at the
                bottom of every page of the MedicineStudies Sites. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Market Research</h3>
            <br>

            <p>From time to time, MedicineStudies may conduct online research surveys on behalf of itself and third
                parties through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus groups. When participating in a
                survey, we may require you to provide your location, age and if there’s a sweepstakes associated with
                the market research survey, your name and contact information for purposes of sweepstakes
                administration. The information you submit in a survey may be used by MedicineStudies for research and
                measurement purposes, as described below, including to measure the effectiveness of content, advertising
                or programs. The personal information you provide in connection with a sweepstakes entry will be used
                for the sole purpose of administering the sweepstakes and as required by applicable law. We will not
                knowingly invite individuals who are under the age of 13 to participate in market research surveys.
                Market research surveys conducted by or on behalf of MedicineStudies will contain a link to this Privacy
                Policy. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>User Reviews, MedicineStudies Message Boards, and Other Public Forums</h3>
            <br>

            In connection with the use of our Physician Directory, users are able to submit provider reviews.
            MedicineStudies also features several message board areas and other public forums where users can post
            reviews, share information and support one another or where users can post questions for experts to answer.
            We also offer online discussions moderated by healthcare experts. Our reviews feature in the Physician
            Directory and our message boards are open to the public and should not be considered private. </p>
            <p>Any information (including personal information) you share in any review, online message board, or other
                forum is by design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting any
                personal information in any public forum. What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by third
                parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for
                unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the information you post may also show up
                in third-party search engines. </p>
            <p>If you mistakenly post personal information in our message board areas and would like it removed, you can
                send us an email to request that we remove it by using the Contact Us link on every page of the
                MedicineStudies Sites. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Emails You Send to MedicineStudies</h3>
            <br>

            <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or
                inventions that you send to MedicineStudies by email. If you want to keep content or business
                information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to
                MedicineStudies. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Services and Device Information</h3>
            <br>

            <p>When you access and use the Services, MedicineStudies automatically collects and stores in its server
                logs information from your browser or mobile device such as your IP address or unique device identifier,
                browser information (including referring URL), your preferences and settings, cookies and information
                about the content you have viewed and actions taken (e.g., search queries, ad engagement, clicks and the
                associated dates and times). MedicineStudies may also collect device-specific information when you
                install and use an App including your device model, operating system information, advertising ID (which
                is a unique, user-resettable identification number for advertising associated with a mobile device) and
                App version and usage information. When enabled by you, we collect precise location information provided
                by your mobile device, which you may disable through the device settings. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
            <br>

            <p>We and our partners use cookies to collect information about your use of the Services. “Cookies” are
                small data files assigned to your browser when you visit a MedicineStudies Site which enable recognition
                of your browser and collect and store information about your use of the Services, as described above. In
                addition to cookies, we and our partners use other tracking technologies that collect information about
                your use of the Services, including mobile identifiers and "web beacons" which are small graphic files
                (sometimes called “clear GIFs” or “web pixels”) embedded in a web page or email typically used to
                monitor activity and send relevant information back to a home server (which can belong to the host site,
                a network advertiser or some other third party). The information collected by such tracking technologies
                may be combined with other information that our partners have access to, including your name, email
                address and physical address, so that we can send you materials, either electronically or by direct
                mail, that may be of interest to you. </p>
            <p>Our advertising service partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information
                about your use of the MedicineStudies Sites, including content you have viewed. These third parties may
                use this information to help MedicineStudies deliver advertising on the MedicineStudies Sites and on
                other third party websites based on your browsing activity on the MedicineStudies Sites. MedicineStudies
                may further tailor the advertising on the MedicineStudies Sites and these other third party websites
                based on additional information to the extent known by MedicineStudies or these third parties. Two of
                the third parties that MedicineStudies works with are Google and Facebook. In addition to using the
                information it collects performing services for MedicineStudies, Google may also use such information as
                described in its privacy policy. To see how Google may use information collected through our use of the
                Google services on the MedicineStudies Sites visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.
                While Facebook does not provide any personal information to MedicineStudies, Facebook may use
                information that it has about you and that it collects performing services for MedicineStudies (which
                may be associated with personal information that Facebook has about you) as described in its privacy
                policy available at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy. </p>
            <p>We also work with third party ad networks to display advertising on our MedicineStudies Sites and on
                third party websites. Our ad network vendors use technologies to collect information about your
                activities on the MedicineStudies Sites and in our flagship MedicineStudies App to provide you
                cookie-based targeted advertising on our MedicineStudies Sites and on third party websites based upon
                your browsing activity and your interests.
                For more information about our how cookies and other tracking technologies are used in connection with
                the Services, please read our Cookie Policy. </p>
            <p>When you download and install one of our Apps onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your
                App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you
                personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a
                manner similar to our use of cookies as described in this Privacy Policy and in our Cookie Policy.
                Unlike cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser,
                because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed
                through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use
                cookies, please do not use the Apps. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies on our mobile
                optimized sites and our flagship MedicineStudies App are similar to our use on our desktop sites. Your
                choices to reject cookies, use the Network Advertising Initiative and the opt-out mechanism described
                below in the section "Your Choices and Rights" are available on our flagship MedicineStudies App and on
                our mobile optimized sites. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>How Information Collected About You Is Used</h3>
            <br>

            <p>Information about your use of the Services may be used for the following purposes:
                • to provide, improve and create new Services,
                • to respond to your inquiries and to send you administrative communications about the MedicineStudies
                Sites and Services,
                • to obtain your feedback about the MedicineStudies Sites and Services,
                • to send you secure electronic messages and personalized emails pertaining to your interests as
                inferred from your use of the Services, including news, announcements, reminders and opportunities from
                MedicineStudies,
                • to statistically analyze trends and user behavior and activity including how frequently areas of the
                MedicineStudies Sites are visited, how the Services are being used and how many emails are received and
                opened,
                • to provide you and people with similar demographic characteristics and interests with more relevant
                content including advertising both on and off the MedicineStudies Sites and Apps,
                • to offer lead generation services,
                • to detect and defend against fraud and other threats to the Services and our users,
                • to identify issues with the Services,
                • to conduct research and measurement activities, including those described below, and
                • to administer your account. </p>
            <p>In addition, MedicineStudies may use personal information about you for other purposes that are disclosed
                to you at the time we collect the information and/or with your consent.
                MedicineStudies may combine your personal information and other information collected about your use of
                the Services, and also supplement with information from external sources for the purposes described in
                this Privacy Policy. For example, information that MedicineStudies collects about you may be combined by
                MedicineStudies with other information available to MedicineStudies through third parties for research
                and measurement purposes, including measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs.
                This information from other sources may include age, gender, demographic, geographic, personal
                interests, product purchase activity or other information. We may report aggregate information, which is
                not able to be identified back to an individual user of the MedicineStudies Sites, to our current or
                prospective advertisers and other business partners. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
            <br>

            <h4>MedicineStudies Subsidiaries and Corporate Affiliates</h4>
            <br>

            <p>We may share your information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and companies acquired by or merged with
                us and our affiliates. In the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale
                to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of a sale of assets or a bankruptcy, MedicineStudies
                reserves the right to transfer your personal information to the new party in control or the party
                acquiring assets. In the event of such a change, your personal information will continue to be treated
                in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless any changes to the Privacy Policy are made in accordance
                with the section below that discusses “Changes to This Privacy Policy.” </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Companies and Contractors that Work with MedicineStudies</h4>
            <br>

            <p>MedicineStudies works with third party companies and contractors that help us provide the Services and to
                otherwise assist in the operation of the MedicineStudies Sites and Apps, including those that provide
                services relating to technology, data analysis, research, email management and deployment, sweepstakes
                and contest administration, advertising and marketing and/or content. MedicineStudies contractors
                sometimes have limited access to your information in the course of providing products or services to
                MedicineStudies. We contractually require that our contractors not use or disclose your information for
                any purpose other than providing the limited service or function for MedicineStudies. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Third Party Advertisers and Third Party Websites</h4>
            <br>

            <p>We may share information that we have about you, such as a cookie ID or IP address, with third party
                advertising service providers who may use this information, on our behalf, to help MedicineStudies
                deliver advertising on the MedicineStudies Sites as well as on third party websites, as further
                described in our Cookie Policy. </p>
            <p>Certain content, services and advertisements offered to you through the MedicineStudies Sites are served
                on, or contain links to, websites hosted and operated by a company other than MedicineStudies ("Third
                Party Websites"). MedicineStudies does not share your personal information with these Third Party
                Websites without your consent, but you should be aware that any information you disclose to these Third
                Party Websites once you access these Third Party Websites is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
                MedicineStudies does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party
                Websites. You should review the privacy policy posted on the Third Party Website to understand how that
                Third Party Website collects and uses your information. MedicineStudies makes an effort to make it
                obvious to you when you leave a MedicineStudies Site and enter a Third Party Website, either by
                requiring you to click on a link or by notifying you on the MedicineStudies Site before you visit the
                third party site. In addition, if you see a phrase such as "Powered by" or "in association with"
                followed by the name of a company other than MedicineStudies, then you are on a website hosted by a
                company other than MedicineStudies. When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner
                of MedicineStudies, such as MedicineStudies Lab Testing), or register or otherwise provide information
                on a co-branded site, where applicable, we may pass the collected information back to that partner,
                which may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within
                the Services. </p>
            <p>We may also include social widgets on the MedicineStudies Sites which enable you to interact with the
                associated social media services, e.g., to share an article. These widgets may collect browsing data
                which may be received by the third party that provided the widget, and are controlled by these third
                parties. You may be able to manage your privacy preferences directly with the applicable social network
                platform. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Compliance with Law, Regulation, and Law Enforcement Requests</h4>
            <br>

            <p>To cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with
                law, we may release personal information to third parties: (1) to comply with legal requirements such as
                a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; (2) when we believe in good faith that
                disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
                fraud, or respond to a government request; or (3) in special cases, such as in response to a physical
                threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In addition, we may
                disclose personal information as described below. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>How Your Information is Secured and Retained</h3>
            <br>

            <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect the security of your personal information. Despite
                MedicineStudies's efforts to protect your personal information, there is always some risk that an
                unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your
                information over the Internet may be intercepted. </p>
            <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter personal information
                (including personal health information in various Services), we encrypt the transmission of that
                information or use SSL connections (Secure Socket Layer) technology. </p>
            <p>We will retain your personal information as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
                Services. At any time you can remove your personal information or instruct us to remove it, but you
                should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the
                information you have provided to MedicineStudies from our servers. See “Your Choices and Rights” below
                for more information on how you can update or remove your personal information. We will also retain your
                personal information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our
                agreements. </p>

                information you have provided to the MedicineStudies Sites from our servers. </p>
            <p>When you sign up to receive email communications for any of our Services, including our email
                newsletters, or at any time, you can choose to opt out of receiving additional newsletters or other
                email communications from MedicineStudies or our advertisers or sponsors. </p>
            <p>You can unsubscribe from an email newsletter by:
                • Following the directions included at the bottom of the newsletter and using the “Unsubscribe” link
                found in the emails.

            <p>If you decide that you would prefer not to receive personalized email or secure electronic messages from
                the MedicineStudies Health Manager tool, you may also "Opt-out" of the Service by clicking on the
                settings tab on your Health Manager home page and changing your email preference or following the
                unsubscribe instructions included in each email. </p>
            <p>All promotional emails that MedicineStudies sends with opportunities from MedicineStudies or with offers

            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <br>

            <p>Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the
                browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" or “Settings” or “Preferences” section of your browser’s

            <h4>Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out</h4>
            <br>

            <p>In order to give you more control over your privacy choices we have implemented a DAA (Digital
                Advertising Alliance) approved opt-out mechanism for interest-based advertising. At the bottom of every
                page of the MedicineStudies Sites you will see an AdChoices logo (which looks like this: ). In our
                flagship MedicineStudies App you can find the AdChoices option in the “Settings” screen. By clicking on
                that logo on the MedicineStudies Sites or following the instructions in the flagship MedicineStudies
                App, you will be presented with a window that will identify all of the companies that MedicineStudies
                uses to direct tailored advertisements to you, both on the MedicineStudies Sites and in the flagship
                MedicineStudies App as well as on third-party websites. If you would like to stop this tailored
                advertising from MedicineStudies, you can manage these advertisements through the choices in that
                window. Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive
                generic advertisements through the Services. Please note that your choice to stop tailored advertising
                is specific to the browser or mobile device that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from
                one computer or mobile device and you want your opt-out to apply to a different computer or mobile
                device as well please opt out from that computer or mobile device too. By clicking the + symbol next to
                the name of a vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that vendor assists us
                with the delivery of advertisements. The MedicineStudies Sites do not respond to web browser "do not
                track" signals. This opt-out mechanism is available in the flagship MedicineStudies App for iOS and
                Android, as well as on our mobile optimized sites, but is not currently available on our other Apps
                (MedicineStudies Pregnancy, MedicineStudies Baby and MedicineStudies Allergy). </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Mobile Opt-out</h4>
            <br>

            <p>You may also control interest-based advertising on your mobile device by enabling the “Limit Ad Tracking”
                setting in your iOS device’s settings or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” in your Android device’s
                settings. This will not prevent you from seeing advertisements, but will limit the use of device
                advertising identifiers to personalize ads based on your interests. If you have questions about how to
                reject cookies on your specific device please check with the device manufacturer. </p>
            <br>

                the minor's use of MedicineStudies Health Manager. The parent or guardian assumes full responsibility
                for ensuring that the registration information is kept secure and that the information submitted is

                other jurisdictions may not afford the same level of data protection as considered adequate in your own

                defend legal claims; and (viii) necessary to protect your vital interests, or those of others. </p>
            <p>If you are a MedicineStudies user in the EEA, you can: (i) access personal information we have about you
                (we will try to provide information within 30 days of your request); (ii) have your personal information
                corrected or deleted (in most cases you can correct personal information you have submitted to us by
                going back to the specific Service, logging-in and making the desired change); (iii) in certain
                circumstances, you can object to our processing of your personal information and we will discontinue
                such processing unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue; (iv) withdraw consent
                previously provided (however a withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing of your personal
                data that occurred prior to the date of withdrawal); or (v) if you believe that we have not complied
                with applicable data protection laws, you may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

                information, you may contact us as described in the Contacting MedicineStudies About Your Personal

                obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or anonymize it. If you have registered with
                MedicineStudies and you no longer want us to use your registration information to provide the Services
                to you, you may close your account. </p>
